## Overview  

Environmental challenges like forest fires and improper waste management demand innovative solutions. This repository showcases two projects that combine artificial intelligence and computer vision to provide actionable solutions:  

- **Forest Fire Detection Using Satellite Imagery**: A CNN-based model that analyzes satellite data to identify fire-prone regions, visualize risk areas, and support disaster mitigation efforts.  

- **Waste Sorting Using Computer Vision Model**: An AI-powered system that automates the classification of waste into recyclable and non-recyclable categories, aiding sustainable waste management practices.
