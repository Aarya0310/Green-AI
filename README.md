## Overview  
Overview
Forest fires are one of the most devastating natural disasters, causing irreversible damage to ecosystems, wildlife, and human settlements. Rapid identification of fire-prone areas is critical to minimize destruction and protect vulnerable communities.

This project utilizes satellite imagery combined with advanced machine learning techniques to analyze forested regions for signs of fire hazards. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to process the spatial data and generate predictions of potential fire outbreaks. The outputs include detailed heatmaps that can guide authorities and decision-makers to implement early warning systems, allocate resources efficiently, and save lives.

With the rising availability of satellite data and improvements in AI, this project demonstrates how technology can address environmental challenges in a scalable and impactful way.
