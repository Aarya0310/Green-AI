## Project 1: Forest Fire Detection Using Satellite Imagery üî•

### Description  
Forest fires are one of the most devastating natural disasters, causing irreversible damage to ecosystems, wildlife, and human settlements. Rapid identification of fire-prone areas is critical to minimize destruction and protect vulnerable communities.

This project utilizes satellite imagery combined with advanced machine learning techniques to analyze forested regions for signs of fire hazards. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to process the spatial data and generate predictions of potential fire outbreaks. The outputs include detailed heatmaps that can guide authorities and decision-makers to implement early warning systems, allocate resources efficiently, and save lives.

With the rising availability of satellite data and improvements in AI, this project demonstrates how technology can address environmental challenges in a scalable and impactful way.  

### Features  
- Input: Satellite images of forested regions.

## Project 2: Waste Sorting Using Computer Vision Model ‚ôªÔ∏è

### Description  
Improper waste management is a growing environmental issue that contributes to pollution, resource wastage, and adverse effects on human health. Manual waste sorting, while common, is often inefficient, prone to errors, and labor-intensive. Automating this process can significantly improve recycling efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint.

This project employs a computer vision model to classify waste items into specific categories, such as plastic, glass, paper, and organic materials. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fine-tuned on waste classification datasets, the model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing various types of waste.

The solution is designed to be scalable, making it suitable for integration into industrial automated waste sorting systems or small-scale local recycling units. By reducing dependency on manual sorting and improving precision, this project aims to promote sustainable waste management practices globally.


### Features  
- Input: Images of waste items.  
- Output: Waste classification into predefined categories.  
- Model: Fine-tuned CNN pre-trained on waste datasets.
