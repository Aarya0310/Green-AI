## Overview  
Forest fires pose significant environmental, economic, and social risks. This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process satellite imagery and identify high-risk areas for forest fires, providing actionable insights for early intervention.  

---

## Features  
- **Input**: Satellite images of forest regions.  
- **Output**: Predictions and heatmaps indicating fire-prone areas.  
- **Model**: Deep learning model trained on geospatial datasets.  
- **Visualization**: Fire risk heatmaps for actionable insights.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- Geospatial libraries (e.g., GDAL, Rasterio)  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Folium
